To complete homework effectively with collaboration

This is the space where everyone should do all the homework tasks.

So that it will be visible to everyone what every member of the team is doing

Good luck and keep on track with the git!!!

How to start a collaboration:

**1**. Clone the repository to your local directory

**2**. Create inside a directory new file with the name of your FirstName.

* Structure of writing to your file with  `Your Firstname`
   
   Example
   ```
   TODO: 
   - 1A
   - 2C
   - 2D
    
    COMPLETED:
   - 1A:
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5 doing
   ```
**3**. Inside the new file write on the each line the tasks that you have done:
    
    -better write the scripts that you have already executed on each line of the file
    -also recommended that you will keep track of this file so that everyone is sure where you are;))

**4**. Copy all the files that were created during execution of your scripts to this directory

**5**. Write the report into the file `Assignment.md`
    
   * Structure of writing the report
   
   > Write the explanation or description where it is needed and if screenshot is needed, put the name of the screenshot and put the screenshot itself to the directory screenshots (*do not forget to put the unique name for your screenshots like* `1A.1.jpg`)
   
   Example of how to write into file `Assignment.md`
   > ##### Part 1
   > ##### A.
   > 1 ) ls - List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default)
   > [screenshot `1A.1.jpg`]    

**6**. Make a commit with the unique message that is distinguishable from other commits.

**7**. Push your commit and relax for a while, you did the great job.

**8**. Now, good luck and keep going on doing the assignment with your new commits and pushes;))

This is the space where everyone should do all the homework tasks.

So that it will be visible to everyone what every member of the team is doing

Good luck and keep on track with the git!!!

How to start a collaboration:
    
    1. Clone the repository to your local directory
    2. Create inside a directory new file with the name of your FirstName.
    3. Inside the new file write on the each line the tasks that you have done:
        -better write the scripts that you have already executed on each line of the file
        -also recommended that you will keep track of this file so that everyone is sure where you are;))
    4. Copy all the files that were created during execution of your scripts to this directory
    5. Make a commit with the unique message that is distinguishable from other commits.
    6. Push your commit and relax for a while, you did the great job.
